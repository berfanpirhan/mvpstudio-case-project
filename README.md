Steps to run the project:

1. Install the Expo client globally with the following command:
npm install -g expo-cli

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the root folder for the repository, and install all dependencies with the following command:
npm install

4. Run the application with the following command:
npx expo start

5. From here on, the app can either be run on a physical device by scanning the QR code that appears by using the Expo Go app (both Android and iOS) or scanning the QR code (iOS only).

6. Alternatively, the app can also be run on emulators through the following commands:
npx expo start --android
# or
npx expo start --ios
